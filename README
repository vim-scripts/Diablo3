Diablo3 is a color scheme inspired by molokai. It supports both gui and 256-color term.

Options:

If you want to set long line warning, copy this in your vimrc:

  let g:diablo3_longline = 1


The default length of a line is 120, you can change it by putting
the following in your vimrc:

  let g:diablo3_len = 79

Notice the length here is the length you want to set plus 1.
